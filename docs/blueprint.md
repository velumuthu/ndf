## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Off-white (#FAF9F6), a light tint of the primary, providing a gentle contrast that makes elements pop.
- Accent color: Pale gold (#E2CAA0), a light, desaturated version of yellow to introduce luxury and sophistication in key elements.
- Font Pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text. The former offers a modern and fashion-conscious appeal, while the latter brings readability and elegance for longer text passages.
- Use minimalist line icons in a light gold tone (#E2CAA0) to represent categories and actions.
- Use a clean, spacious layout with ample whitespace to enhance the feeling of luxury and sophistication.
